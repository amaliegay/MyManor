MyManor is a Morrowind mod that allows players to purchase the Hlaalo Manor furnished or empty after solving the murder.

It may either be used with the original engine, with MWSE. In this case, only the ESP must be activated.

It may also be used with a development version of OpenMW, in this case, you must activate the ESP and the omwscripts file in the OpenMW launcher.
